<h1>Philosophers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Philosophers</strong> project, part of the curriculum at 42. This project is based on the classical synchronization problem known as the "Dining Philosophers Problem." The goal is to understand and implement solutions for managing concurrent processes and avoiding deadlocks.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of the "Philosophers" project is to simulate a scenario where a certain number of philosophers sit at a table with a fork between each pair. Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating. They must pick up both forks to eat, which leads to challenges in synchronization and resource management.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The philosophers program must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Correctly simulate the philosophers' behavior of thinking, eating, and sleeping.</li>
	<li>Ensure that no two philosophers can use the same fork simultaneously.</li>
	<li>Avoid deadlock and ensure that all philosophers get a chance to eat.</li>
	<li>Implement proper synchronization mechanisms to manage shared resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>: The ability to manage multiple processes or threads executing simultaneously.</li>
	<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: Techniques for coordinating the access to shared resources in concurrent programming.</li>
	<li><strong>Deadlock</strong>: A situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource held by another process.</li>
	<li><strong>Mutexes and Semaphores</strong>: Synchronization primitives used to control access to shared resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <strong>Philosophers</strong> project is an excellent opportunity to delve into the complexities of concurrent programming and synchronization. By completing this project, you will gain valuable experience in managing concurrent processes, avoiding deadlocks, and implementing synchronization mechanisms, which are critical skills for any systems programmer.</p>
